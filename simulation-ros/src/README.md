# The Src folder


All the source code files for all packages are in this folder. 

The three foldes here are meta-packages.
### 1.vrep_ros_interface
(Enyu) It seems you don't need to check this package. We have installed it in the previous configuration.
### 2.turtlebot2i
(Enyu) The most important and complex metapackage. 
### 3.phantomx_pincher_arm
(Enyu)Something about arm.  
**Todo:** Enyu haven't checked it. 

**Note:** This README was wroten by Enyu Cao <enyu.cao@ericsson.com>, and it should be checked by other colleague before merge to other branch.
